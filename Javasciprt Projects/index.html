    <!-- Variables and Constant
    1. const = Value not change.
    2. let = Now a days for declaring any variable data type we use "let"
    3. var = This type of data type is become old. As it has some kind of problem with blocks "{}".In initial days it does'nt use block {} with js components. So when developer make a variable in function with the same name of variable that is declared in above area. It change its value.
    4. Without declaring any data type = By this appraoche we can also store a value in variable without declaring its datatype.
